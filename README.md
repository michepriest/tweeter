# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. I had some fun with the theme and created 'dinochat'.

This repository is the starter code for the project: Students will fork and clone this repository, then build upon it to practice their HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery and AJAX front-end skills, and their Node, Express and MongoDB back-end skills.
